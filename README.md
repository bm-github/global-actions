# Automated README Generator

## Project Description

This project is an automated README generator designed to scan a repository's content and create or update a README.md file based on the files present. It uses AI-powered text generation to produce accurate and relevant documentation for your project.

The main script, `generate_readme.py`, is responsible for:

1. Scanning the repository for specific file types
2. Reading the contents of matched files
3. Generating a README using either the Anthropic or OpenAI API
4. Handling large content by chunking it into smaller pieces for API processing

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install anthropic openai
```

4. Set up the necessary environment variables:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `AI_MODEL`: The AI model to use (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo" for OpenAI or "claude-2" for Anthropic)

5. Create a `.github/config/file_types.json` file to specify the file types and glob patterns to scan for in your repository.

## Usage

To use the README generator:

1. Ensure your environment variables are set correctly.
2. Run the script:

```
python scripts/generate_readme.py
```

The script will:
- Scan your repository for the specified file types
- Generate a README based on the repository content
- Output the generated README content

You can then review and save the generated content as your README.md file.

This README provides an overview of the project based on the `generate_readme.py` script. As more files are added to the repository, you may need to update this README to reflect additional functionality or components.Here's the continuation of the YAML file for the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Generate README
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          AI_PROVIDER: ${{ secrets.AI_PROVIDER }}
          AI_MODEL: ${{ secrets.AI_MODEL }}
        run: |
          python generate_readme.py
          echo $readme_generated

      - name: Commit and push if changed
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add README.md
          git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet || (git commit -m "Update README.md" && git push)
```

This continuation of the YAML file includes the following steps:

1. Install dependencies: This step upgrades pip and installs the required packages from the requirements.txt file.

2. Generate README: This step runs the generate_readme.py script. It sets the necessary environment variables using GitHub Secrets for API keys and AI provider settings. The script's output (readme_generated) is echoed for potential use in subsequent steps.

3. Commit and push if changed: This step configures Git with a local user, adds the README.md file, checks if there are any changes, and if so, commits and pushes the changes to the repository.

This workflow will run whenever there's a push to the 'readme-update' branch or when manually triggered. It will generate or update the README.md file using the AI provider specified in the secrets, and then commit and push any changes back to the repository.I apologize, but I don't actually have access to generate or modify files on your system. The code snippet you provided appears to be part of a GitHub Actions workflow that generates a README file using a Python script.

To generate the actual content for the README.md, you would need to:

1. Create the Python script (.github/scripts/generate_readme.py) that generates the README content.
2. Run that script locally or as part of your GitHub Actions workflow.
3. The script would then create or update the README.md file with the desired content.

Without more context about your project or what specific information you want in your README, I can't generate the exact content. However, I can provide a general template for a README.md file that you could use as a starting point:

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of your project.
